1. What would you consider to be your strongest technical ability and why?
   • What have you done to excel in your <technical ability>?
   • How did you go about learning <technical ability>?
   • Tell me about a time when you used <technical ability> effectively and how it impacted a project?
   Java is the strongest technical ability and have been interest while pursing engineering degree. Used online resources
   to get good understanding on the subject. Extensively used Java on college project for which is mainly encryption and also used along with RFA authentication as well.

2. What programming language(s) are you most comfortable using and what have you built using this language? What are some obstacles you went through and how did you overcome them?
   • What steps did you take to learn this language?
   • In what ways have your education and technical classes helped you learn this language?
   • Tell me about your Python skills and any libraries you have used or are currently learning?
   • Do you have any examples?

Java is most comfortable.
Stuck implementing the code on encryption methods but gone through the subject while deep dive in to online courses and troubleshooting techniques.
As most of the time prefer doing the practices internally and help implement same doing project as well.


3. Tell me about a time you had a technical project with little direction or ambiguity?
   • How did you handle it?
   • How did you make decisions and ensure you met your deadlines?
   • What is your approach to collaborating with others?

There were times stuck on proceeding on few methods and check with friends and take guidance to clear doubts and proceed further to meet deadlines. She likes collaborating with teams which helps understand either requirements or subject in faster way.

4. What excites and interests you about technology and our Technology Development Program?
   • Why this track / why UHG?

She feels it is a great opportunity to work with talented teams and learn/explore and contribute to teams.

5. How do you keep your technical skills sharp and up to date?
   • What projects have you taken on in your own time?
   • What was the outcome of those projects?

Most of time doing online search on the topics and courses to up to date on it. She worked on encryption and decryption methods and implement RFA authentication mechanism in her project.

6. Tell me about a time when your first solution to a technical/data/product problem did not work out.
   • What pushback did you receive?
   • How did you solve for it, and what was the outcome?
   • What is your trouble-shooting process?

Will try to debug the problem on what exactly the error and root cause and where it is failing and once identified will update the code again.

7. Explain your research/thought process when designing new software.
   • What pushback did you receive?
   • How did you solve for it, and what was the outcome?
   • What is your approach to collaborating with others?
