|  Easy | Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. Example below. <br> Input: "the sky is blue" <br> Output: "blue is sky the"                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  Easy | Given an array with 0s, 1s, and 2s - sort the array without actually doing sorting and any built-in functions                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Easy | Write a program that will take a string input and generate the following series. <br> Sample Input:: a3b4c2 <br> Output: aaabbbbcc <br>                                                                                                                                                                                        | Make this moderately difficult by asking to consdier multiple digit integers following an alphabet.                                                                  |
| Medium | The Two Sum Problem - You are given an array of n integers and a number k. Determine whether there is a pair of elements in the array that sums to exactly k. For example, given the array [1,3,7] and k = 8 the answer is "yes", but given k = 6 the answer is "no"                                                           | If the candidate provides O(N^2), look for efficient approaches O(N log N) OR linear time solution                                                                   |
| Medium | Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. Note: One or Thow additional variables fine. An extra copy of the array is not.                                                                                                                         |
| Medium | Given a sentence, sort the words of a sentence according to the their individual lenghts. If one or more words have same length then sort the words by first character of the word. <br> Input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog  <br> Output: dog fox the The lazy over brown jumps quick                          |
| Hard | Given a pair of words, return the minimum number of characters you need to remvoe in order to make them into an anagram. Assume input has only lower case alphabets. <br> read, dare => 0 (already anagram) <br> reading, dare => 3 (need to remove i, n and g) <br> reading, darefff => 6 (need to remove i, n, g, f, f and f) ||
| Hard | Given an array of numbers, arrange them in a way that yields the largest value. Fox <br/>example, if the given numbers are {54, 546, 548, 60}, the arrangement 6054854654 gives the largests value. And if the given numbers are {1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45,4}, then the arrangement 998764543341, gives the largest value.      | If the problem seems tricky for the candidate to grasp in first attempt, start by asking how they can find the characters that differ between the two given strings. |
