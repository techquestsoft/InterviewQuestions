### 1.Differences between nodes, pods, and containers
    In Kubernetes, understanding the differences between nodes, pods, and containers is crucial for deploying and managing applications. Here's a breakdown with an example:
    
    Node:
    
    Think of it as a physical or virtual server that runs the Kubernetes environment.
    A node provides the computing resources like CPU, memory, and storage for running pods.
    In our example, imagine Node 1 as your physical server where Kubernetes is installed.
    Pod:
    
    Think of it as a logical unit of deployment that represents one or more containers.
    Pods share the same network namespace and local storage (optional).
    They are the smallest entity you can schedule and manage in Kubernetes.
    Let's imagine Pod 1 running on Node 1, which could contain two containers:
    Container 1: A Java application container hosting your microservice.
    Container 2: A sidecar container running a logging agent.
    Container:
    
    Think of it as a standardized, isolated package of software with its own runtime environment (e.g., JVM for Java application).
    It contains everything needed to run your application, including code, libraries, and dependencies.
    Pod 1 in our example consists of two containers, each running a specific application or supporting function.
    JVM Installation:
    
    JVM will be installed inside the container running your microservice application (Container 1 in our example).
    It's packaged within the container image with all the necessary dependencies.
    Microservice Deployment:
    
    Your microservice will be deployed inside the container dedicated to it (Container 1 in our example).
    The container image will package your microservice code, libraries, and the JVM configuration.
    Example Summary:
    
    Your microservice runs inside Container 1 of Pod 1, which is scheduled on Node 1.
    Node 1 provides the physical resources, Pod 1 groups related containers, and Container 1 holds your microservice with its specific JVM configuration.
    This is just one example, and deployment complexities can vary depending on your needs.
